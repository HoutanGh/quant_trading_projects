##### These are mostly notes for myself 

Gonna do Black-Scholes Model then gonna do it with heston probability then something with Monte Carlo.

Black-Scholes assumes that the volatility is constant which is not true.

#### Black-Scholes (volatility assumption)
Trying to calculate the fair price of an option by taking into account risk and time. 

Delta - how sensitive the option price is to the underlying asset
Gamma - rate of change of delta w.r.t underlying assest price 
Vega - how sensitive to volatility (same for calls and puts)
Theta - sensitivty to time decay (how much the option loses each day as it reaches expiration) 
Rho - sensitivty to risk free interest rate


#### Information I should know 

derivative, options, futures, swaps
