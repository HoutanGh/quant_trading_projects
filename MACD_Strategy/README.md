### MACD Strategy

Basic premise of trading logic:
- when short moving average is larger than the long moving average it signals an upward trend and vice versa

Doesn't seem to be that effective for volatile stocks or sudden changes as will predict them quite late, seems to better for S&P 500 stocks. Though, make changing the rolling windows would have a better effect but for extremely volatile stocks the MA1 and MA2 would have to be very similar, making their usage pointless and just having one moving average would fair the same or better. 

Cool idea but like all strategies, can go well but can also go really wrong.

[] Will implement strategy so can use for all stocks soon.
